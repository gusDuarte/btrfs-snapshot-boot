This is a shell script addition to the Ubuntu initramfs tools that will create
btrfs snapshots of all top-level subvolumes (in each btrfs filesystem) on every
boot.

To use this on your system:
* Copy initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/btrfs-snapshot to
  /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount
* Run 'update-initramfs'
* Reboot and cross your fingers. If your system doesn't boot correctly and/or
  you see a '(initramfs)' BusyBox prompt:
  - boot from a live CD 
  - Fix/delete /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount in your
    root filesystem
  - Run 'update-initramfs' again

*** IF YOU ARE USING UBUNTU 12.04 OR OLDER ***
There are two issues:
* The version of btrfs-tools in Ubuntu Precise can't make a read-only snapshot
  of a subvolume. Until btrfs-tools 0.19+20120328 (or newer) is backported, you
  must edit btrfs-subvolume.sh to remove the '-r' argument.
* The btrfs tool that's copied into the initrd is the 'btrfsctl' tool instead
  of 'btrfs', so I worked around this with a big hack -- I overrode the btrfs
  hook script to also copy 'btrfs'. To do this on your system, append the
  contents of initramfs-tools/hooks/btrfs-addition to
  /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/btrfs. Of course, re-run 'update-initramfs'
  after this change. I don't like this solution at all and it seems quite
  fragile, but supporting Ubuntu 12.04 isn't my first priority.
