This is a shell script addition to the Ubuntu initramfs tools that will create
btrfs snapshots of the root and home subvolumes on every boot.

This works with my specific hard drive partition scheme: /dev/sda1 is btrfs
with the default subvolume structure done by the Ubuntu installer. That is,
subvolume '@' is / and '@home' is /home.

To use this on your system:
* Edit initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/btrfs-snapshot to match your
  partition layout/configuration
* Edit btrfs-snapshot.sh to match your subvolume layout
(as root:)
* Mount the root subvolume of your btrfs filesystem somewhere, and copy
  btrfs-snapshot.sh to the top level of the root subvolume
* Copy initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/btrfs-snapshot to
  /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount
* Run 'update-initramfs'
* Reboot and cross your fingers. If your system doesn't boot correctly and/or
  you see a '(initramfs)' BusyBox prompt:
  - boot from a live CD 
  - Fix/delete /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount in your
    root filesystem
  - Run 'update-initramfs' again

This is still very much a proof-of-concept.
TODO:
* Check whether the root filesystem is btrfs before doing anything
* Don't assume /dev/sda1
* Move functionality from btrfs-snapshot.sh directly into the initrd script.
  Previously, I would run btrfs-snapshot.sh myself after booting from a USB
  drive, and to get something working it was easiest to have the initrd script
  do what I was already doing.
* Be smarter about which subvolumes to make snapshots of, instead of hardcoding
  '@' and '@home'. It might suffice to filter the output of 'btrfs subvolume
  list' and make snapshots of every subvolume that doesn't contain '/' in its
  path.

*** IF YOU ARE USING UBUNTU 12.04 OR OLDER ***
The version of btrfs-tools in Ubuntu Precise can't make a read-only snapshot of
a subvolume. Until btrfs-tools 0.19+20120328 (or newer) is backported, you must
edit btrfs-subvolume.sh to remove the '-r' argument.
